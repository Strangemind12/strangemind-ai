Automated Group Replies Without Opt-In

🚫 Problem: Meta is strict about consent and automation.

> If your bot responds to every group message that mentions @Strangemind, and users haven’t opted into that interaction? Violation.



✅ Allowed: Reply only when users first message the bot privately or explicitly interact (e.g. typing /start).

❌ Not allowed: Bot automatically responding in groups without user initiation.
